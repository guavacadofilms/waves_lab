READ ME! :)

Repository for my second year "Waves" lab cycle. Included files:

- fourier.py
---> a very basic script containing a function to calculate N terms of a Fourier series and plot them. Task 1.2 in the lab script specifies a sqaure wave with period Ï„ = 240 and amplitude T(t) 0 to 100.

The following libraries are required for the script to function, 
all of which are included in the conda environment:
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
