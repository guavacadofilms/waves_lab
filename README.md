READ ME! :)

Repository for my second year "Waves" lab cycle. Included files:

- fourier.py
---> a very basic script containing a function to calculate N terms of a Fourier series for a square wave and plot them. Task 1.2 in the lab script specifies a sqaure wave with period Ï„ = 240 and amplitude T(t) 0 to 100. The fourier series for this was solved analytically then transcribed into python.

The following libraries are required for the script to function, 
all of which are included in the conda environment:
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
