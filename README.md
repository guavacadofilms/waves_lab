READ ME! :)

Repository for my second year "Waves" lab cycle. Included files:

- waves_lab_script.pdf
-> document provided which details our experiment, split into three tasks
- fourier.py
-> a very basic script containing a function to calculate N terms of a Fourier series for a square wave and plot them. Task 1.2 in the lab script specifies a square wave with period Ï„ = 240 and amplitude T(t) 0 to 100. The fourier series for this was solved analytically then transcribed into python.
- task_1.3_semicircle_low.txt and task_1.3_semicircle_high.txt
-> two data files for plotting a semicircle, one with low resolution (0.1 au) and one with high res (0.01 au) for the purpose of the following script
- num_integration.py
-> again, very basic script for task 1.3 to perform numerical integration under a curve (specifically the data sets above). This is done by plotting a series of rectangles under each curve and summing their areas. These estimations are then compared to the actual area.

The following libraries are required for the script to function, 
all of which are included in the conda environment:\
numpy\
matplotlib\
seaborn
